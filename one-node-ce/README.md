# Running Vertica with Docker

[Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/) is a massively scalable analytics data warehouse that stores your data and performs analytics on it all in one place.

This Dockerfile creates a single-node container using the [Vertica Community Edition](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/GettingStartedGuide/DownloadingAndStartingVM/DownloadingAndStartingVM.htm) (CE) license. The CE license includes:
- [VMart example database](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/GettingStartedGuide/IntroducingVMart/IntroducingVMart.htm)
- Admintools
- vsql
- Developer libraries

## Prerequisites
Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

# Supported Platforms

Container techology provides the freedom to run environments independently of the host operating system. For example, you can run a CentOS container on an Ubuntu workstation, and vice versa.

Vertica provides a Dockerfile for different distributions so that you can create an containerized environment that you are the most comfortable with. This is helpful if you need to access a container shell to perform tasks, such as administering the database with [admintools](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/AdminTools/WritingAdministrationToolsScripts.htm).

## Vertica:
- 11.x
- 10.x (beta)

## CentOS
- 8.3
- 7.9

## Ubuntu
- 20.04
- 18.04

Vertica tests the CentOS containers most thoroughly.  Dockerfile_Ubuntu is provided for those who have a Vertica .deb file instead of a Vertica .rpm file, and can be adapted for recent versions of Debian.

# Building the image

## Store the Vertica RPM or DEB

To build an image using this repository, you must store your Vertica RPM or DEB archive in the `./packages` directory.

If you do not have a Vertica RPM, register to download the free [Community Edition](https://www.vertica.com/try/) license. This is a limited license that allows you to create a three-node Vertica cluster with a maximum of 1TB of storage.

## Build the image with `Makefile`
This repository contains the `Makefile` script that creates an image with a [DBADMIN role](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/DBUsersAndPrivileges/Roles/PredefinedRoles.htm).

Export the following variables to customize the image properties:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default Values |
| :--------------------| :-----------| :--------------|
| TAG          | Required tag of the image. | latest |
| IMAGE_NAME   | Required name of the image.| vertica-ce |
| OS_TYPE      | Required OS Type.          | CentOS | 
| OS_VERSION   | Required OS versions.      | CentOS: 7.9.2009<br> Ubuntu: 18.04 | 
| VERTICA_PACKAGE | Name of the .rpm or .deb file | CentOS: vertica-x86_64.RHEL6.latest.rpm<br>Ubuntu: vertica.latest.deb |

> **NOTE**: If the defaults are not be suitable for your environment, edit the `Makefile` to use more appropriate defaults.

If you do not specify VERTICA_PACKAGE, and TAG is not set to `latest`, then the TAG must be the Vertica version because it is used to construct the version portion of the VERTICA_PACKAGE name.

### Examples:
```shell
# Builds image with default values.
make 

# Builds image with custom image name and tag.
make IMAGE_NAME=one-node-ce TAG=latest

# Build image with Ubuntu base OS.
make OS_TYPE=Ubuntu Tag=latest  

# Build image with a non-default filename for the rpm.
make VERTICA_PACKAGE=vertica-11.0.0.x86_64.RHEL6.rpm
```

## Build Custom image

To customize build-time variables including the default database user, and group, and database name, export following optional variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default Values |
| :--------------------| :-----------| :--------------|
| VERTICA_DB_USER   | OS user and implicit database [superuser](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/DBUsersAndPrivileges/Privileges/AboutSuperuserPrivileges.htm).  | dbadmin |
| VERTICA_DB_UID    | Vertica user uid.                        | 1000 |
| VERTICA_DB_GROUP  | Group for database administrator users.  | verticadba | 
| VERTICA_DB_NAME   | Vertica database name.                   | VMart | 

### Example:
```shell
make IMAGE_NAME=one-node-ce TAG=latest VERTICA_DB_USER=vertica VERTICA_DB_UID=1200
```

After `Dockerfile_<distro>` installs the RPM or DEB file, it runs `tools/cleanup.sh`. `tools/cleanup.sh` trims the size of the distribution by removing less-commonly used files, and applies other file-size reduction techniques.

# Testing with ./run_tests.sh

After you build the container, you can test it with `make test` or with the `./run_tests.sh` script. The `./run_tests.sh` script verifies that the container can execute Vertica and some of the additional libraries.

> **IMPORTANT**: `./run_tests.sh` requires a [local copy of the vsql client](#getting-a-local-copy-of-vsql). 

The `./run_tests.sh` script uses the normal Vertica port number, so you must stop any existing Vertica server (container or otherwise) on your test system before you test your container.

The test uses your image to create a new container with a unique tag and volume. Because the test sets up the optional libraries and creates the VMart database, creating a new container can take up to three minutes.

If the tests pass, `All tests passed` appears at the end of the output, and the script exits with a 0 exit status. If the test fails with errors, the output contains `ERROR: <description>`, where `<description>` is a description of the error.

You can run the script with the `-k` argument to retain the container and make it available for examination after testing:

```shell
./run-test.sh -k
```

When you are done with the container, you must manually remove it:

```shell
docker stop vertica_ce_<suffix>
docker rm vertica_ce_<suffix>
docker volume rm vertica-test-<suffix>
```
In the previous command, `<suffix>` refers to the numeric suffix (the PID of the test-script shell that created the container and its volume). When used with the `-k` flag, `run-test.sh` prints out the above commands and populates `<suffix>`.

# How to use this image

## Start the Vertica server instance

This repository contains the `start-vertica.sh` script with the following options:

```shell
Usage: ./start-vertica.sh [-c cname] [-d cid_dir] [-h] [-i img_name] [-t tag] [-v hostpath:containerdir] -V docker-volume
Options are:
 -c - specify container name (default is vertica_ce)
 -d - directory-for-cid.txt (default is the current directory)
 -h - show help
 -i image - specify image name (default is vertica-ce)
 -p port - specify a port number to use for vsql to talk to vertica
 -t tag - specify the image tag (default is latest)
 -v hostpath:containerdir - mount hostpath as containerdir in the 
        container (in addition to the data docker volume)
 -V volume - docker volume to use for the Vertica database (default is vertica-data)
```

> **NOTE**: By default, the container name is `vertica_ce`. Use this name to identify the container in your local Docker registry, with commands like `docker start` and `docker stop`.

### cid.txt file

The `start-vertica.sh` script creates the **cid.txt** file, which stores the container ID within the container. By default, **cid.txt** is stored in current working directory. You can specify a directory to place the **cid.txt** file using the `-d cid_dir` option. For example, the following command places **cid.txt** in the home directory:

```shell
start-vertica.sh -d /home
```
> **NOTE**: You must have read and write access to the `cid_dir`.

## Start with `docker run`

You can also use `docker run` to start the server instance. In the following example, `vertica-ce:latest` is the container image you created in [Building the image](#building-the-image):

```shell
docker run -p 5433:5433 \
           --mount type=volume,source=vertica-data,target=/data \
           --name vertica_ce \
           vertica-ce:latest
```


## Custom scripts

The entrypoint script can run custom scripts during startup. You must store the scripts in a local directory named `.docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. To make these scripts accessible by the entrypoint script, mount this directory in the container filesystem in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. Scripts are executed in lexicographical order.

Supported extensions include:
- `sql`: SQL commands executed with vsql
- `sh`: Shell scripts

The following command creates a bind mount:

```shell
docker run -p 5433:5433 \
           --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/.docker-entrypoint-initdb.d,target=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ \
           --name vertica_ce \
           vertica-ce:latest
```

For more information, see [Use bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) in the Docker documentation.

## Container shell access

If you used the `start-vertica.sh` script to [start the server instance](#start-the-vertica-server-instance), use the `run-shell-in-container.sh` script to access a shell within a container. This script uses the **cid.txt** file that the `start-vertica.sh` creates to store the container ID. In the following command, `<cid_dir>` is the directory that stores **cid.txt**:

```shell
./run-shell-in-container.sh [-d directory-for-cid.txt] [-n container-name] [-u uid] [-h ] [ ? ]
```

You must specify either `-d directory-for-cid.txt` or `-n container-name`. For example, `-n vertica_ce`.

`-u uid` specifies what user runs inside the container. Vertica recommends that you use DBADMIN_ID (default 1000), because that user has proper access to Vertica directories inside the container.

> **NOTE**: If you have a [local copy](#getting-a-local-copy-of-vsql) of `vsql`, you do not need to access a container shell unless you need to use [admintools](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/AdminTools/WritingAdministrationToolsScripts.htm).

Alternately, use the `docker exec` command to access a shell in the container. Using `docker exec` requires that you provide the container name:

```shell
docker exec -it <container name> bash -l
```

After you access a shell, run `/opt/vertica/bin/vsql` to connect to the database and execute `vsql` commands on the files and volumes mounted in the container.

You can access a container shell and vsql with a single command: 

```shell
docker exec -it <container_name> /opt/vertica/bin/vsql
```

## Viewing container logs

Fetch the container logs with the `docker logs` command. The following command uses **cid.txt**:

```shell
docker logs `cat cid.txt`
```
The following command fetches the logs for a container named **vertica_ce**:

```shell
docker logs vertica_ce
```
## Stopping the container

Stop the container with the `docker stop` command. The following command uses **cid.txt**:

```shell
docker stop `cat cid.txt`
```
The following command stops a container named **vertica_ce**:

```shell
docker logs vertica_ce
```

# External database access

The container exposes port 5433 for external client access. To access the database from outside the container, you must have a [local copy of the vsql client](#getting-a-local-copy-of-vsql).

## Getting a local copy of vsql

See [Client Drivers](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/) in Vertica Downloads to download all available client drivers.

## Accessing the database

By default, the Dockerfile creates the `dbadmin` user in the container database. The following command accesses the database:
```shell
vsql -U dbadmin
```
You can configure the database user name with the `vertica_db_user` ARG variable in the Dockerfile or when you [build the custom image](#build-custom-image).

## Persisting data

This container mounts a Docker volume named **vertica-data** in the container as a persistent data store for the Vertica database. A Docker volume is used instead of a mounted host directory for the following reasons:

- Cross-platform acceptance. Docker volumes are compatible with Linux, MacOs, and Microsoft Windows.
- The container runs with different username to user-id mappings. A container with a mounted host directory might create files that you cannot inspect or delete because they are owned by a user that is determined by the Docker daemon.

For details about managing volumes, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

> **NOTE**: Docker volumes live on the host filesystem as directories. These directories are created automatically and stored at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`. Each volume is stored under `./volumename/_data/`. This might limit the amount of data you can store in your database if that directory is on a small filesystem.

## Extending the image

The `dbadmin` user environment is extended to be user-friendly. For details, see the [vertica_env.sh](env_setup/vertica_env.sh) and [.vsqlrc](env_setup/.vsqlrc) scripts.

## Environment Variables

To configure various aspects of Vertica in container runtime, inject corresponding environment variables when executing the `docker run` command:
```shell
docker run -p 5433:5433 -d \
  -e TZ='Europe/Prague' \
  vertica-ce:latest
```
The following table contains configurable environment variable parameters:

| Environment Variable | Description | 
| :--------------------| :-----------|
| APP_DB_USER | Name of a database user, in addition to `vertica_db_user`. This user is created only when this variable is set. By default, this user is assigned [pseudosuperuser](https://www.vertica.com/docs/latest/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/DBUsersAndPrivileges/Roles/PSEUDOSUPERUSERRole.htm) privileges. |
| APP_DB_PASSWORD | Password for APP_DB_USER. If this is omitted, the password is empty. |
| TZ: "${VERTICA_CUSTOM_TZ:-Europe/Prague}" | The database time zone.<br><br>**IMPORTANT**: Vertica does not contain all timezones. Each Dockerfile contains a  commented-out workaround solution that begins "Link OS timezones". Uncomment the workaround to use time zones.<br>Setting the time zone with VERTICA_CUSTOM_TZ enables you to override it from your environment. |
| DEBUG_FAILING_STARTUP | For development purposes. When you set the value to `y`, the entrypoint script does not end in case of failure, so you can investigate any failures. |
