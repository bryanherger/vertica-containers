# Since this script is a wrapper for other commands (which have their
# own command-line arguments that we don't want to interfere with),
# most of the option-setting for this script is done using environment
# variables.
#
# For example, $OSTAG-v$VERTICA_VERSION is used to define the docker image
# (e.g., vertica/verticasdk:centos-v11.0.0).  So, if you have multiple
# verticavsdk images lying around, you can select among them by
# defining these variables in the environment.
#
# VSDK_IMAGE: select your docker image directly
# OSTAG: one of { centos, ubuntu } --- selects the docker image OS
#       version (presumably different from the host operating system,
#       as otherwise the script just picks it up from
#       /etc/os-release).
# VERTICA_VERSION: something like 11.0.0-0
#
# In addition, there are these environment variables:
#
# VSDK_MOUNT: an optional space-separated list of host directories to
#       mount in the UDx container --- that is, "I'm going to want to
#       refer to files in these directories in, for example, my
#       makefile, or as include directories in code to be compiled"
#
# VSDK_ENV: names a file filled with variable definitions.  This uses
#       the --env-file option of the "docker run" command, so the file
#       needs to be formatted for that option
